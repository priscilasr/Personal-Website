            <p class="pb">My name is Priscila Santos Romo. I am a Computer Science major, minoring in Cybersecurity. Originally, I am from Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico, but since 2011, I have primarily lived in San Antonio and consider Texas my home. From a young age, I have been fascinated with computers, as both my mother and father work in the computer science field. My oldest sister, Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of '19, also makes her living in the computer science field. Therefore, I have been surrounded by like-minded people for my entire life, and it's only natural that I am following them down the same path. </p>
            <p class="pb">Just recently, I have started undergraduate research under the supervision of Professor Dilma Da Silva. The research involves stream computing with a focus on Apache Zookeeper and understanding how it works. During the Summer of 2021, I worked at the Texas A&M GenCyber Camp as a student technician. There, we taught high school students about Cybersecurity and Python to help them pursuit their interests in computing fields. I am currently in my Junior year at Texas A&M and I am a member of Theta Tau Xi Gamma Fraternity. Theta Tau is a co-ed professional engineering fraternity focused on brotherhood, professionalism, and philanthropy. My educational interests are Cybersecurity and Software Development. In the future, I would love to find a job as a Security Software Developer and expand my Father's business from Mexico into the United States.</p>
            <p class="pb">When I find myself with spare time, I enjoy backpacking through various parts of Mexico and the United States, baking, and volunteering, especially with animals. I'm very excited to see where this path takes me and what lies ahead in the near future. There are tremendous opportunities in the computer science and cybersecurity fields. I hope to see my peers succeed alongside me, as I wish to do myself. </p>
            <p class="pb">Thanks and Gig' Em!</p>
